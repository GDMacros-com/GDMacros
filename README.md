# GDMacros

A community catalog of Geometry Dash macros, styled after the Global Demonlist / AREDL layout.

The entire catalog lives in **one file**, [`data/macros.json`](data/macros.json). Adding a macro
means appending one object and opening a pull request; the site rebuilds from it.

- **Stack:** Next.js 15 (App Router) · React 19 · Tailwind CSS v4 · TypeScript
- **Output:** fully static. Every page is prerendered at build time, with no server and no database
- **Hosting:** deploys to Vercel with zero config, or to GitHub Pages via static export

## Quick start

```bash
npm install
npm run dev          # http://localhost:3000
```

| Command            | What it does                                          |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `npm run dev`      | Dev server with hot reload                            |
| `npm run build`    | Production build (prerenders a page per macro)        |
| `npm start`        | Serve the production build locally                    |
| `npm run validate` | Check `data/macros.json` for missing/invalid fields   |

## Adding a macro

[`data/macros.json`](data/macros.json) ships with **8 blank template rows**. Fill them in one at a
time. A row where every required field is still empty is skipped at build time, so the site builds
and deploys fine with half the slots blank. Add more rows (or delete spare ones) whenever you like.

A row with *some* fields filled is treated as a mistake, not a placeholder, and fails the build with
a message naming the missing field. That way a half-finished entry can't slip out silently.

Fill a row in like this:

```json
{
  "name": "Acheron",
  "creator": "ryamu",
  "levelId": 73667628,
  "video": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpNIkIBPOhw",
  "description": "Optional note shown on the page.",
  "macros": [
    {
      "author": "ChesszDC",
      "recorder": "xdBot",
      "downloadType": "MediaFire",
      "downloadLink": "https://www.mediafire.com/file/.../Acheron.gdr2/file"
    }
  ]
}
```

Order doesn't matter, the site always sorts alphabetically by `name`.

### More than one macro per level

Add another object to `macros`. There is no limit.

```json
"macros": [
  { "author": "ChesszDC", "recorder": "xdBot",     "downloadType": "MediaFire",    "downloadLink": "https://..." },
  { "author": "Zoink",    "recorder": "Mega Hack", "downloadType": "Google Drive", "downloadLink": "https://..." }
]
```

They are numbered by their position in the array, so the level page shows **Macro 1 by ChesszDC**
and **Macro 2 by Zoink**, each with its own recorder, download host and copy button. Reorder the
array to renumber them.

With a single macro the catalog row names its author directly. With several it shows a "3 macros"
badge instead, and the authors appear on each macro card on the level page.

### Field reference

Level fields:

| Field         | Required | Notes                                                            |
| ------------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `name`        | **yes**  | The level. Sorted, searched, and used for the URL                 |
| `creator`     | **yes**  | Who built the level, shown as the green tab                       |
| `levelId`     | **yes**  | Powers the GD Browser button: `https://gdbrowser.com/<levelId>`    |
| `macros`      | **yes**  | Array of one or more macros, fields below                         |
| `video`       | no       | YouTube URL. Renders the embed and auto-generates the thumbnail   |
| `thumbnail`   | no       | Image override: absolute URL, or a path like `/thumbnails/x.png`  |
| `description` | no       | Short note shown under the video                                  |
| `slug`        | no       | URL override. Defaults to the level name, slugified               |

Macro fields, inside `macros[]`:

| Field          | Required | Notes                                                          |
| -------------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `author`       | **yes**  | Who recorded this macro, shown as "Macro N by ..."              |
| `recorder`     | **yes**  | `"Mega Hack"`, `"xdBot"` or `"zBot"`. Anything else fails the build |
| `downloadType` | **yes**  | Where it's hosted: `"Google Drive"`, `"MediaFire"`, `"MEGA"`, etc. |
| `downloadLink` | **yes**  | Direct URL to the macro file                                    |

`recorder` is a closed set defined by `RECORDERS` in [`src/lib/types.ts`](src/lib/types.ts). The
catalog accepts those three tools, and the home page filters on it. A level matches the filter
when **any** of its macros used the selected recorder.

`downloadType` is free text, so any host works. These get a tinted icon:
Google Drive, MediaFire, Dropbox, MEGA, GitHub, Discord, OneDrive.

### Older entries

The previous flat shape, where a single macro's fields sat directly on the level, is still read and
converted on load. Nothing breaks if you have old entries, but new ones should use `macros`.

### Thumbnails

Resolved in order, first match wins:

1. **`thumbnail`**: an absolute URL, or a file you drop in `public/` (e.g. `/thumbnails/society.png`).
2. **`video`**: the YouTube still is used automatically. *No image file needed.*
3. **Neither**: a generated gradient tile with the level's initial.

The easiest good-looking setup is to just fill in `video`.

### URLs

Each macro gets `/macro/<slug>`, where slug defaults to `<name>-<macroAuthor>` slugified.
`"Society"` + `"wPopoff"` → `/macro/society-wpopoff`. Two macros for the same level by different
authors won't collide. If you do hit a duplicate, the build fails with a message telling you to add
a `slug` field.

### Before committing

```bash
npm run validate
```

Errors (missing required fields, an invalid `recorder`, non-numeric `levelId`, duplicate URLs, a
`thumbnail` that isn't in `public/`) fail the check. Warnings (placeholder download link, no image
source) are informational. Blank template rows are counted separately and never fail anything.

## AdSense

The publisher id is public and is already wired into the root layout and `public/ads.txt`. Actual
ad units stay off until both the feature flag and their public slot ids are configured. Create two
responsive **Display** ad units in AdSense, then add these Vercel environment variables for the
Production environment only:

```text
NEXT_PUBLIC_ADSENSE_ENABLED=true
NEXT_PUBLIC_ADSENSE_HOME_SLOT=<numeric catalog ad unit id>
NEXT_PUBLIC_ADSENSE_MACRO_SLOT=<numeric macro-page ad unit id>
```

The catalog gets one unit before its results and a macro page gets one after all macro content and
navigation. Account, admin, submission, notification, settings and support pages have no ad units.
The ad-block reminder is detected locally, can always be dismissed, remembers dismissal only for
the current tab, and never prevents access.

After deployment, verify that `https://www.gdmacros.com/ads.txt` displays exactly the publisher line
from `public/ads.txt`. AdSense can take time to crawl it; do not add a second seller line unless that
seller is genuinely authorised for this site.

AdSense's Google CMP remains configured in the AdSense dashboard. Keep its three-choice European
message published. Do not enable Auto ads as well unless the manual-placement limits are being
deliberately replaced; running both would defeat the restrained layout.

## Deploying

### Vercel (recommended)

Push to GitHub, then import the repo at [vercel.com/new](https://vercel.com/new). Vercel detects
Next.js automatically, so there are no settings to change. Every push redeploys, so merging a macro PR publishes it.

Then set your real domain in [`src/lib/site.ts`](src/lib/site.ts) so metadata and share cards use
absolute URLs.

### GitHub Pages (optional, and not needed if you use Vercel)

The site uses no server-side features, so it also exports to plain HTML. No config edit is needed:
static export is switched on by environment variables, so the same repo builds for both hosts.

```bash
NEXT_OUTPUT=export NEXT_BASE_PATH=/GDMacros npm run build   # writes out/
```

[`.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml`](.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml) does exactly this. It is
**manual-only** (Actions tab → Run workflow) so it never runs, and never fails, unless you ask for
it. To use it, set **Settings → Pages → Source: GitHub Actions**, then run it once.

`NEXT_BASE_PATH` must match the repo name when serving from `<user>.github.io/<repo>`. Drop it if
you point a custom domain at Pages.

---

## Translation

The navbar language menu is wired to Google's free **website translate widget**
([`src/components/GoogleTranslate.tsx`](src/components/GoogleTranslate.tsx)).

This is deliberately *not* the Google Cloud Translation API. That one needs a paid API key, and on a
static site there is nowhere to hide a key. It would sit in the page source for anyone to lift and
bill to your account. The widget needs no key, costs nothing, and works on pure static hosting.

Two details worth knowing:

- Google's own banner and tooltip are suppressed in `globals.css`. The `body { top: 0 !important }`
  rule matters, because without it Google pushes the page down 40px and breaks the sticky navbar.
- Level names, creator handles, macro author handles, recorder names and download hosts are all
  marked `translate="no"`, so "Bloodbath" doesn't become "Baño de sangre". **If you add new UI that
  renders a proper noun, mark it the same way.**

Edit the offered languages in `LANGUAGES` in [`src/lib/site.ts`](src/lib/site.ts). Any code Google
Translate accepts works.

---

## Search / SEO

The site is built to be indexed well for "geometry dash macros" and related phrases.

**What the code already does**

- `<title>` leads with the phrase, not the brand: `Geometry Dash Macros | GDMacros`. Level pages use
  `<Level> Macro (Geometry Dash) | GDMacros`.
- The home `<h1>` is literally "Geometry Dash Macros". Heading text is the strongest on-page signal.
- Every page has a unique meta description. Level pages generate one containing the level, the
  creator, the macro authors and the recorders. A custom `description` is appended to it, never
  substituted for it, so a personal note can't cost the page its keywords.
- Canonical URLs on every page, so `?q=` and `?view=` variants don't split ranking.
- `sitemap.xml` regenerates from the catalog on every build, and `robots.txt` points at it.
- JSON-LD structured data: `WebSite` with a `SearchAction` (site-wide), `CollectionPage` +
  `ItemList` (home), and `CreativeWork` per level.
- OpenGraph and Twitter card tags, so shared links show a title, description and thumbnail.
- Static prerendered HTML with no client-side data fetching, which is the easiest thing for a
  crawler to read.

**What no amount of code can do**

Ranking is not something a build step decides. Google has to discover the site, crawl it, and judge
it worth showing above the pages already ranking for that phrase. That depends on the domain being
live, on other sites linking to yours, and on time. A brand new domain does not rank on day one no
matter how the HTML is written.

**What you have to do yourself, in order**

1. Point `gdmacros.com` at the Vercel deployment and confirm it loads over HTTPS.
2. Add the site to [Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console) and verify
   ownership via the DNS TXT record.
3. Submit `https://gdmacros.com/sitemap.xml` there, then use "Request indexing" on the home page.
4. Get a few real links: your YouTube channel description, a pinned Discord message, a Reddit or
   forum post. Links from places people already are matter more than anything on this list.
5. Add macros. A catalog with 60 levels has 60 more chances to match a search than one with 5, and
   each level page targets its own long-tail phrase like "acheron macro".
6. Wait. Two to eight weeks for a new domain to settle is normal.

If `site.url` in [`src/lib/site.ts`](src/lib/site.ts) does not exactly match the domain you serve
on, the sitemap and canonical tags will point at the wrong place and indexing will suffer. That one
value matters more than everything else in this section.

---

## Customising

**Branding and links:** [`src/lib/site.ts`](src/lib/site.ts): `name`, `url`, `repo`.

**Colours:** [`src/app/globals.css`](src/app/globals.css). The palette is two blocks at the top:
`:root` (dark, the default) and `[data-theme="light"]`. Change a value in both and it propagates
everywhere, including Tailwind utilities like `bg-surface` and `text-muted`. The green and blue
credit tabs use `--green` and `--accent`.

**Download host colours:** the `HOST_ACCENT` map in [`src/lib/format.ts`](src/lib/format.ts).

### Ordering and ranking

Ordering is **alphabetical by level name, always**. It isn't configurable from the UI, and nothing
is ranked. Discovery is the search box, which matches level name, level creator, macro author,
level ID, recorder and download host. Press <kbd>/</kbd> to jump to it, <kbd>Esc</kbd> to clear.

The only filter is **recorder** (All / Mega Hack / xdBot / zBot), which is linkable as `?recorder=zBot`.
Search and view mode are in the URL too (`?q=`, `?view=grid`).

> The Next.js badge you may see in the bottom-left corner during `npm run dev` is the framework's
> dev-tools indicator. It never appears in production builds, so it won't show on Vercel, and
> `devIndicators: false` in `next.config.mjs` now hides it locally as well.
