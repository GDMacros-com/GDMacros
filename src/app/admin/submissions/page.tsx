/**
 * The review queue.
 *
 * Three independent things have to agree before any data appears:
 *
 *   1. the proxy redirects an anonymous visitor to /login;
 *   2. this page checks the role server side, from the database;
 *   3. the row level security policy on `submissions` only returns other
 *      people's rows when private.can_moderate() is true.
 *
 * The third is the one that matters. Even if the first two were removed, a
 * normal user reaching this page would render an empty queue, because the
 * database would hand them nothing. And every review RPC checks
 * private.can_moderate() for itself, so seeing a button is not the same as being
 * able to use it. Editing a submission's details is no different: the
 * `admin_update_submission` RPC does its own check and refuses once publishing
 * has started.
 *
 * A non-admin gets a 404 rather than a "forbidden" page: there is no reason to
 * confirm that this route exists.
 *
 * Only ACTIVE submissions exist now. An accepted or rejected one is deleted and
 * replaced by a small notification to its submitter, so there is no history to
 * filter and no approved or rejected tab.

   *
   * Nothing in the review path touches auth.users, which is why an email
   * address cannot reach this page even by accident. Both id columns are
   * dropped below rather than handed to the client.
   *
   * There is exactly ONE place that reads auth.users, and it is not this one:
   * `lib/supabase/auth-admin.ts` enumerates accounts so a legal notice can be
   * emailed to them. It is server-only, reachable solely through the Mail
   * everyone tool, and no address it reads reaches the browser.
