/**
 * The only way a macro file gets into Storage.
 *
 * The browser never talks to Supabase Storage: the bucket has no policies for
 * `anon` or `authenticated`, so a direct upload is refused even under your own
 * user id. That is what makes this route the single choke point where the magic
 * bytes, the size and the field limits are actually enforced.
 *
 * Order of operations, and why:
 *
 *   1. authenticate with getUser(), which validates the token rather than
 *      trusting a cookie;
 *   2. require a profile, because a submission is attributed publicly;
 *   3. validate every field and the file itself, server side, because a browser
 *      check is advice rather than enforcement;
 *   3b. RE-FETCH the level from GDBrowser and the video from YouTube, and store
 *      what THEY say. The search UI is not a security boundary: a modified
 *      request could otherwise pair a real level id with any name and creator
 *      it liked. Only the id is taken from the request; the name and creator
 *      are whatever GDBrowser returns for it;
 *   4. generate the submission id here, so the caller cannot choose it;
 *   5. upload the object FIRST;
 *   6. create the row second, as the user, so RLS and the RPC's own checks
 *      apply;
 *   7. if the row fails, delete the object.
 *
 * Upload before insert is deliberate. A failed insert leaves an unreferenced
 * private object: invisible to everyone and cheap to sweep. The reverse order
 * would leave a visible broken submission an admin cannot download. The worse
 * orphan is the row, so the order avoids it.
