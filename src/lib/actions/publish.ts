 * The two entry points for automated publishing.

 * A server action is a POST endpoint that anyone on the internet can call, so

 * `private.can_moderate()` for itself, exactly as the 2D review functions do. The
 * check here exists to fail fast with a sensible message and to avoid doing
 * expensive work for someone who will be refused anyway.
 *
 * THE BROWSER SENDS ONE THING: a submission id. Repository, release, tag, asset
 * name, download URL, level metadata, recorder, macro author and the catalog
 * payload are all derived on the server from the trusted row. Nothing a caller
 * sends can redirect the publisher at another repository or another file.
