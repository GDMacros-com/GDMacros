 * WHAT A CHECK MAY REPORT
 * -----------------------
 * A label, a state, a duration, and a SHORT human detail. Never a key, never a
 * URL with a token in it, never a raw upstream error body. The status page is
 * behind an admin gate, but "only an admin can see it" is not a reason to put
 * a credential on a page: the whole point of the checks is that they exercise
 * the credentials, so an error string is exactly where one would leak.
