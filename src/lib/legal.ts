/**
 * The single source of truth for legal document versions.
 *
 * Public metadata only. Nothing here is secret, and nothing here may become
 * secret: this module is imported by client components (the signup form, the
 * Terms and Privacy pages) and so ships to the browser.
 *
 * THE UPDATE WORKFLOW
 * -------------------
 *   1. edit the Terms and/or Privacy page copy
 *   2. bump the version and effective date below
 *   3. deploy
 *   4. optionally notify account holders with the admin Legal Notices tool
 *
 * The database keeps its own copy of these values in `private.legal_documents`,
 * because the server must stamp an acceptance record from a value the browser
 * cannot influence. The two are asserted to match by `npm run test:legal`, so a
 * bump here that is not mirrored in a migration fails the suite rather than
 * silently recording the wrong version.
 *
 * Versions are date based. That makes "which one did I agree to" answerable at
 * a glance, and sorts correctly without a parser.
