/**
 * The automated publisher.
 *
 * ORDER OF IRREVERSIBLE WORK
 * --------------------------
 *   not_started      -> upload the recorder's macro file       (irreversible)
 *   asset_uploaded   -> commit data/macros.json to main        (irreversible)
 *   catalog_committed-> observe production serving that commit (observation)
 *   live_verified    -> finalise: delete submission, notify    (irreversible)
 *
 * Each transition is recorded in `private.submission_publish_state` immediately
 * after the side effect that earns it. The whole function is therefore
 * restartable at any point: it looks at the recorded state and skips whatever
 * has already happened.
 *
 * NOTHING IS FINALISED EARLY. Every failure before `live_verified` leaves the
 * submission in Processing with its file intact and the submitter told nothing.
 * A macro is only ever "accepted" once a visitor could actually download it.
 *
 * WHAT THE BROWSER IS TRUSTED WITH
 * --------------------------------
 * A submission id. That is all. Level identity, macro author, recorder, the
 * asset filename, the repository, the release tag and the catalog payload are
 * all derived here from the database row and from GDBrowser.

       *
       * So: ask. Re-reading the row costs one query and answers it exactly.
       *
       * The inference is sound only because of what THIS invocation already
       * established from the database, not from the browser: begin_publish
       * returned this submission as status = 'processing' with publish state
       * live_verified, moments ago. For a row in that state the lifecycle
       * leaves exactly one way to disappear:
       *
       *   - reject_submission and withdraw_submission both match on
       *     status = 'pending', so neither can touch a processing row;
       *   - release_processing now refuses once publishing has started;
       *   - submissions has no client delete policy at all;
       *   - finish_processing is the only remaining path, and it requires
       *     live_verified, which is exactly the state we read.
       *
       * The one other way a row can vanish is the account being deleted, which
       * cascades. That is vanishingly unlikely mid-publish, and even then the
       * macro really is published: the asset and the catalog commit are already
       * live, which is what "finished" means to the person reading this screen.
